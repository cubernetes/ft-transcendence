# ft-transcendence - a pong web app

> A pong app with a heap of add-on features

## Live Demo

- Frontend: [https://ft-transcendence.app](https://ft-transcendence.app)
- Backend API: [https://ft-transcendence.app/api/docs](https://ft-transcendence.app/api/docs) (not in production)
- ELK: [https://ft-transcendence.app/kibana](https://ft-transcendence.app/kibana)
- Vault: [https://ft-transcendence.app/vault](https://ft-transcendence.app/vault)

## Configure & Run

- Ensure docker, docker compose, and make are working
- Optionally configure environment settings/ports in env.json
- `make` (without ELK), `make dev-elk` or `make prod`

## Demo

- [a gif showcasing the additional features (accounts, tournaments, stats, etc.)]
- [opt: alt text: a gif showcasing the administrative features, ELK, Vault, etc.]

## Core Features

- interactive webapp to play 3D pong - frontend & backend
- account management
- join matches via the a CLI client
- overkill security measures (ModSecurity, HashiCorp Vault, 2FA, JWT)
- AI opponent
- log management and observability (ELK)
- game statistics
- blockchain persistence (for game statistics)

## Debugging / Development

### Websockets

- Use `wscat` to connect to the websocket server via Caddy:
    - `wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/ws`
    - `wscat -c localhost:8080/ws`
    - `wscat -nc wss://localhost:8443/ws`
- Or connect directly via the backend, by patching `compose.yaml`

    ```diff

        backend:
    +       ports:
    +           - "3000:${BACKEND_PORT:3000}"
            build:
                context: "./backend/"
    ```

    - `wscat -c localhost:3000/ws` (no wss)

### Coraza Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- Checking it it's enabled
    - `curl -vk https://localhost:8443/?exec=/bin/bash` should return `403 Forbidden`
- Disabling it
    ```diff
        log
        handle {
    -       import waf
            root * /frontend/dist/
            try_files {path} /index.html
            file_server
        }
        handle_path /uploads/* {
    -       import waf
            root * /frontend/uploads
            file_server
        }
        handle_path /api/* {
    -       import waf
            reverse_proxy backend:{$BACKEND_PORT}
        }
    ```

### Makefile

When running make (dev), arguments can be added to pass on additional flags for
docker compose up. For instance `make dev ARGS="--no-attach logstash"` will
silence any logs registered by the Caddy container, note that to silence
more the flag needs to be repeated, i.e. `make dev ARGS="--no-attach caddy --no-attach logstash"`.
Similarly, you can also use `ARGS="--attach backend"` for inclusive logging.

### API endpoint

- Check `/api/docs` for a list of backend endpoints auto-generated by swagger UI.

### Vault

See [vault/README.md](./vault/README.md)

### Translatable UI Components (through language Button)

1. ~~**Elements are stored in `translatableElements`**~~ Elements no longer need to be stored anywhere, an attribute will be attached to the element instead so the caller doesn't have to worry about it at all when using component factory function (i.e. createButton, createInput, createContainer, etc.) since they will handle everything internally. When creating element by non standard way, which is highly discouraged, will need to set attribute `CONST.ATTR.I18N_TEXT` (for textcontent, similar process for placeholder for input element, and alt attribute) to the I18Nkey.

2. **Translation Keys are defined in the `TEXT_MAP` object `locale.translation.ts`** Restructured to make adding or editing translation as needed simpler. Typescript will freak out when you don't have required keys (all available languages).

3. ~~**Subscribed to Language Changes with `languageStore.subscribe`:**~~ Again, caller does not need to worry about subscribing, translation is done via one central subscriber in locale.store.

4. Translation string can be templated with syntax of `{string}`. For instance, `Player name {username}` will expand to get username from the object passed to translation uiltilties. It should also be saved in dataset of the element with tag `CONST.ATTR.I18N_VARS` However, all these are handled internally by compontent factory function and should not concern caller.
