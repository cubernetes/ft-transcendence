# Evaluation Roadmap

## Ensure clean environment

- `make deepclean` (everything, +docker, very aggressive)
- `make vclean` (volumes, usually sufficient)
- `make clean` (like `vclean`, but also delete `node_modules` and other files)

## Preparation for vault (for demonstration later)

- change `SAVE_ROOT_TOKEN` and `SAVE_UNSEAL_KEYS` in env.json to `"0"`

## Preparation for online game:

- change env.json -> DEV_DOMAINS to include domain of computer (c4c2c5.42berlin.de, etc.)

## Build

- `make` (development mode)
- `make dev-elk` (development with ELK, slower startup)
- `make prod` (caddy tries ACME for https, privileged ports, etc.)
- `make wait` (in another terminal, only used in conjunction with dev-elk)

- make note of the vault secrets
